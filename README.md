The project “Gestión de una ONG” is oriented towards professionals that work managing an NGO (Non-Governmental Organizations) and its activities. First, the analysis of the problem was completed so that we could identify the needs before creating the solution. The aforementioned was collected in an SRS document. The product consists of a desktop application coded in Java, that also makes use of a database. An STM Microsystems board was used to control the capacity of the NGO’s facilities. Moreover, a statistical analysis has been written surrounding an hypothesis of interest to the NGO. To finish, the NGO’s communication network was designed as well as simulated using Cisco’s Packet Tracer tool. Teamwork Project has been chosen to track the project.
